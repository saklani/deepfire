Money coming soon, tell my niggas be patient
We gonna replace those whips with some sicker ones
We gonna erase them chicks for some thicker ones
Hit and run, bigger funds
But still can't forget to pour liquor
As I reminisce on them niggas that couldn't come
Rest in peace, can't control another man's destiny
So I do what's best for me
I know you fake niggas well, ain't no test to me
On my plate is a meal, ain't no recipe for that
So nigga chill or the tec will speak, "Blaaat!"
Them niggas will put you chest to feet
I'm talking reckless

Y'all dyslexic, got a nigga twisted
Never shot a nigga, I don't gotta get convicted
Cause if I say the word, your whole squad is getting lifted
What up then? Niggas ain't saying nothing? Shut up then!
Wouldn't last a minute in the city I grew up in
Where I got my swag, cool as the breeze is
Chip on my shoulder, I walk like I'm Jesus
About that paper, we could give a fuck if you believe us
Looking for model divas that barely speak English

When that nigga ain't around I just want to pick you up
Bring you back to the crib, sip a little liquor up

I'm on The Come Up
Chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga, finna rise and shine like the sun up
My mind on that paper, I ain't trying to wife the slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't trying to wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up
Uh, don't shed a tear if a nigga might get done up
But, just say a prayer if a nigga might confront us
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the 'Ville? You need to get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, Cobain a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flame, baking soda and water
And if you feel that then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggas like a nigga was still a baby
Carolina nigga shout-out to the 'Ville that raised me
So many hoes whipped, you would've thought we still in slavery
And niggas still sleepin' they feelin' lazy
Uh, a killer maybe, you make me I will
Cheat me on my scrilla, I send you to meet Dilla
From them NC streets where the beef they deliver
And the clip is on E cause your chest got a fill up
While a nigga like me is just getting head like a pillow
Bread like gorillas getting bred
So long as my momma and my niggas getting fed
Fuck what a nigga said, man, I'm Fayettenam bombing
Cause hatred is flattery you bitch niggas is charmin'
Who the fuck you harmin'? Boy, ya'll niggas is charmin'
And I'm armed and waiting for a target
You fucking with the best like Carmen
Aw shit, pardon a nigga for departing
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden
A nigga finna blow while you niggas is false alarmin'
And just think, man, I was raised on ramen -- chicken noodle soup
Now I'm filet mignon-in'
I promised my momma I was coming to make this money
And I swear I'm going to kill the nigga that try to take it from me
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind
A savage over this cabbage
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (No)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs
I'm on my grind, yo, bonafide honcho
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds
Matter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick
Survival's a bitch
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0
God knows I don't put up no facade, no
No fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob
Keep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh
From the other side, punk-ass nigga
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk
Blast pop while I pump gas
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath
My niggas will ride all day like a fun pass
That's some New York shit, I'm from the south, though
Don't never disrespect me out yo mouth, ho
I got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro
Gimmie my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding? (right)
Out for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?(true)
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first 'mil I'm blowing that! (haha)
Like fuck it I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks spend dough on mad shit for stuntin,'(yea)
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggas raised (true)
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid. (uh)
And you should be gettin' laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggas lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin' bout having these nice things, (uh)
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin'
But them whites ain't. (hmmm)
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation,"(yea)
Some niggas gotta walk through life, some niggas roller skating,)
Some niggas bypassing steps, some niggas chose to take 'em. (yea)
And for that fortune, man, some niggas sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin,' I gotta go for mines
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Folgers
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention, (nah)
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition, (ahaha)
Real niggas hustle by using their intuition, (yup)
While these fake niggas ain't into doing, they into wishin,'

Yeah
Uh
I'm out for Presidents to represent me
I'm talking Benjamins, nigga
Grants nigga
From Washingtons, man
Tired of those
Yeah!
Till I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle nigga
Its greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggas couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave till I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin' while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggas riding is devout, so talking violence out yo' mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga!
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y’all
I’ll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
But check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I’ll treat a nigga like Lincoln
Yo, uh
Lifestyles of the young, black and genius
Sons strapped with guns packed in jeans
And the blunts got my lungs black as Jesus, (yea)
Play where killers hung at and slung crack for leisure
And tell a nigga run that get gun clap for sneakers
Young niggas emulate what's coming out the speakers
So everything we learn came from rappers, not teachers
Cause if we can't relate, then how the hell you gonna reach us?
Surrounded by crooked cops and preachers, (yea) Who am I trusting?
No time to think about illegal when your stomachs touching
By any means, nigga, even if the gun is busting
I see the world for what it is now
I see the odds is looking slim for our kids now
Cause, uh, it wasn't set up for my people to rise, (yea)
My niggas slang, but I see the pain deep in they eyes
Niggas living like they don't give a fuck
And I don't blame 'em, it's a cold world, live it up!
Yea, uh
I look up in the sky, see that ghetto bird circling
And rollers on the block, my niggas on the curb, cursing them, (fuck)
Another day in the ville, do I stay in and chill? (no)
Or go play in the field?
Help my mother paying these bills, you tell me, nigga!
We young, black, some strapped
Them whites got they lunch pack for school, we had our guns packed
And all a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that
But they'd rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back
You kill a nigga over beef and cheddar even better
Just one less coon they won't have to arrest soon
Fuck a crooked cop three times
Bitch, I'm getting cake and ain't a nigga finna eat mine
That's why a nigga looking like a street sign, (yea)
Posted on the corner 'til it's sleep time
Wake up and it's feeling like somebody hit the rewind, (why)
Cause them ghetto birds circulate, my niggas still cursin em
Another day in the city, my niggas say it with me, yea!
I'm I-95 cruising, the sun in my eyes
Headed south, dog, my mom ain't seen her son in awhile
Yea, I'll sure is
Can't wait to see my niggas and fuck with my old chicks
Can't wait to cruise the city, be catching them old grins
Same niggas, same place, doing the same old shit
Yea, so nigga watch it!

We pray to God, but, we ain't tryna meet Him yet, haha!
Yea, If I never..
Nigga, man
Actually that is a bad idea, my nigga
'Cause, uh

Momma work to the bone, puttin' clothes on my back
I'm comin' home to give everything I owe to her back, yea
Yeah, I swear they say, man
Yeah, yeah
Listen, alive and still kickin nigga
I survived the ville
But a lot will not, so they wield Glocks and Bonnevilles
Niggas lying, still get high, they ride and kill
Money hungry, tryna find a meal
Can't stay inside and chill
Little niggas thinking: 'fuck school, I'm finna sign a deal!'
Hunting hoes, trapping niggas
Lying like they on the pill
Preachers say we blessed
But all we feel is stressed, tryna deal
If this liquor don't help, nigga, this marijuana will
Roll up, I take a shot for them niggas behind the steel gates
My mind is still- racing, I'm tryna kill- snakes
Cause niggas is fake, but wait, time reveals so
Nevermind, that real shit is what I am tryna build
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
It's kinda I'll how I'm giving y'all that Carolina feel
A nigga so deep, you tryna find me dog, you gotta drill
Yeah

Yo, Coming home, y'all
Listen
At any given time, got the city on my mind
The city on my mind
The city on my mind
I'm riding round feeling like the city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
The city, it is mine
At any given time, Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Carolina on my mind
Said "I feel ya pain nigga, but I'm tryna go for mine,"
I'm tryna go for mine
I'm tryna go for mine

Hey
Ay, fuck them hoes, let them bunnies be
Perfect vision I'm 20/20 for this money, G
See it's funny, you get that paper, then them honeys show
Cause they know we finna blow, like a runny nose
Money goes, the money come
Barely twenty-one, I'm thinking big things
Momma in the mansion with the fish tanks
The Carolina way
If you in college then you know the crime won't pay
Lest you find a way, fuck what them niggas is tryna say
Cause in Carolina- we thorough
My niggas hold it down all the way from Fayettenam to the G-boro
And up in Winston, and Raleigh, did I mention?
The Bull City got them ol' fake niggas flinchin'
Tar heels state, either you shooting or you hoopin' yo
Niggas can't wait for them Panthers to win the Superbowl
So shout out to them super cold niggas up in Charlotte
No matter the city, man, Carolina shine, regardless!
Yea
Yo, coming home nigga!
Was just a youngin’ with that fresh fade
Bird chest, legs skinny
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything I’m wearing
At the fair staring at girls, not a care in the world
Aw nigga, but shit done changed since Maine was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things, tryna kick game
Now I’m a man worried about my fam
Let me explain
It’s like my pockets stay broke, and if not them shit’s sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
You feeling like the world’s on your back so you stumble
In the field like a quarterback get sacked, then you fumble
Jobs don’t call a nigga back, so it’s back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms, the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them, guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost faith
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral (damn)
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
Even the weather’s bad
It be the same shit, got my brain twisted
Like, “Damn it’s ’06 and niggas still up on that gang shit?” (that shit old, dawg)
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen, he was finna to graduate in like three weeks, some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back, they blasted him and left him on the pavement, uh (rest in peace)
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her, she was standing at the bus stop
Wait, man she was eleven!
What the fuck is up with this world?
Got these grown niggas fucking with girls?
Plus the cops harassing us
Every week be blasting us, on accident, or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain, (right)
They killed her only son
Now she wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man, I can’t watch this shit
Take a ride through the city man, tell me what you witness
Poverty, richness, crooked cops and misfits
Violence, hatred, real devastation
Neighborhoods looking like there’s still segregation
Welfare, single mothers, no jobs
Tryna get a piece for yourself, but they hogging up the whole pie
Fiends in the street so high off of that crack shit
This nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress (bang!)
White folks got the road to success mapped and that’s all good
But why don’t blacks got that same atlas?
I asked the same question a million ways
And it seems like I done prayed for a million days
But still the ills remain, just bills and pain
Shootouts in project buildings, children slain
Skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
It's enough to make a nigga wanna cry, but I can’t though
Fuck it, aye
Do or Die, new arrival
Holla at my niggas
You survive you's alive, yo
Now either you follow me and ride, or you's a rival
The difference between you and I is you a model, you posing
But who am I though?
The mulatto out for that lotto
Money coming soon, the newest model
Your crew is hollow
The type of niggas gobble dick, chew and swallow
Your girl told me shoot in her face, she suicidal
Oh shucks, you niggas is closed, you fold up
I'm from the Ville, niggas get killed over four bucks
Thank God we made it, my niggas, we grown up
Now we crazy over that bread, call us the "dough-nuts" uh
More sluts once the money blows up
But them hoes stop if the dough drops
I won't stop though, a chip off the ole' block
I'm from a city where niggas hold blocks
Leave you looking like old socks, damn
Cops patrol blocks, spotting on us
The boys is rotten, I know they want us
Probably arrest a nigga, get a bonus
You kill a nigga, get promoted
Shit is crazy, girls getting babies before they get diplomas
So much I just go nuts
Niggas telling me slow up
Never that
I'm tryna get where that cheddar at
Y'all don't hear me
Always somebody that don't want you getting cheese, yo
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry
I'm kinda very raw, niggas can't deny facts
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq
Honor is something you can't sell or buy back
Niggas don't like bragging, they 9-11 fly cats
Hijack niggas, "Get up out your whip nigga, strip!
I want it all- ice on your wrists and the kicks, "
This shit happens, I ain't just rapping, believe it yo
They got streets in the city police won't even go
Peep it though, uh
It ain't no secret, niggas beefing cause my ego so big
It got me speaking like I'm diesel, like I'm devil, oh
Niggas know my style though, I ain't tweaking, I am lethal though
Have your daddy looking for you
This ain't Finding Nemo though
Let me slow it down, dumb it down, y'all warned
The son came up out that womb, yo, a star is born
If real recognize real, y'all are foreign
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring, yea!
Damn, broke as a bad joke, but still I laugh though
Frontin' tryna have hope, it's sad though
I'm tired of being broke as shit
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6
Aye man, I just graduated, good old college degree
Shit, my niggas drug dealing see more dollars than me
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thing
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like, "You a lame
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man you insane"
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga 'bout to be though
So give me one year then play this back like TiVo
'Cause boy I'm finna blow, I'm a motherfuckin' torpedo
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquito, uh
I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit
Feel like a goddamn kid, man I'm Pac and Big (What up?)
"Up" is something that I can't give
Won't see me disappear like the old Ant Viv'
'Cause even on a slow jam, I'm so damn sick
Man I even spread a virus to a program-quick
I gotta focus on my flow and get some dough, man, shit
No dollars got me actin' like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and to my ex-lady
Yeah we been complicatin' things with the sex lately
Maybe I'm being selfish, but nah, I can't help it
'Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtic, Jersey
Regardless of where God lead us
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina, uh
But I'm through living in the past, Lord
No more thinking rewind, I'm more fast forward
Less rear-view mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizin' cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my mom a whip, nigga, and she ain't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon' get my mama out the struggle, nigga

Fake money, scared money, never make money
And a nigga never fear nothing but God

Hundred thousand dollar deposit shit
Been dreaming 'bout millions since a nigga was five or six
And so I strive, I'm the God, this some bible shit
Nigga I

On the block with the hard hate, that's all they seen
Niggas killing niggas in broad day on all they screens
Watching cops loving car chase scenes
Niggas arrested
Treat us like roaches, the prison's nigga infested
They hate to see the day we ain't slain, niggas invested
All created equal looks like equal to a less than
Depending on your race, or depending on your address, man
I've been blessed, was given less and but still progress, man
I hate to see the position my niggas left in
Sling dope or nigga you slave for minimum wage
Ashamed
But we living in the cage, so nigga get paid, shit

Don't take no from a holes yeah especially in public
J. Cole we way swoll either hate it or love it
Got hoes we take those if you don't like it then fuck it
Look at the product it's nice
Fuck with fire and ice
Cheated on my girlfriend until my tires got sliced
Just got some x pills we gonna try em tonight
Hang on tight girl you going for the ride of yo life
Everything was fine until she said I wasn't her type
Oh I get it all the time its because that I'm white
She was like "nah I'm used to dudes packin' the pipe
So you can just drop me off if you ain't tappin' me right"
I hysterically laughed girl I ain't scared of yo ass
I don ate more pies than even sara lee has
So when I get done with that you wanna marry me ha
Play in the backyard so I can bury the cash
And I can bury the bone cuz I am heir to the throne
I don't need no help see I can carry my own
No time for tricks bitch curly larry or moe
I hit with a big stick it's only fair that you know
This is for them street niggas to them deep niggas
Them politics, them geek niggas
To them freak bitches that swallow dick, it's real
Or them sheep niggas in Prada shit and still
Even them bleak niggas without a cent could feel
I never sleep nigga, I gotta get them mills
I never cheat nigga, my heart is with the Ville
When niggas greet niggas with hollow tips, but chill
You'll never reach nigga, I got an itch to kill
Word, a nigga bringing heat to the third
My shit in every street, like the curb
So bitches wanna meet cause I'm deep with my words
So them niggas wanna peep like a Perv
But peep game
Before they start saying "He changed"
A real nigga can never forget where he came
So if I'm up in Carolina kicking deep game
Or if I'm riding through Queens like the E-train
I throw it up!
Yeah
As you niggas smoking more kush
South niggas run you niggas, ask George Bush
Ask Bill Clinton, a nigga Will Smithin'
My jeans a lil less baggy, money still fittin.'
The streets a lil less rowdy, but they still kickin'
Them Randy Johnson O.G. niggas still pitchin'
And yeah, I know she got a man, but I'm still hittin'
So when he be up in that shit, he be like 'This feels different, "
No shit, throw dick like the veteran I am
I got that vitamin D, it's like medicine to them
I got her climaxing like it's never finna end
That's why she fucking me a lot better than her man
She try a new trick, she so wet a nigga swam
Like a salmon in this bitch, my dick drowning in that shit
They love a fly nigga on that frisbee shit
Plus a nigga get Gs like them Disney flicks
I throw it up!
Yea
Real niggas want the money, so that's where my aim is
Ho niggas love the attention, wanna be famous
Real niggas fuck the attention, they know it's dangerous
Rather make a mil' and nobody know what my name is, (uh)
But that's the price when you nice with it
And them ladies gonna like cause you light-skinned
I take advantage of the situation
I'm hitting dimes from Atlanta up to Pennsylvania
They catch feelings and I switch next
"I made it clear baby, just sex
I'm too young to settle down, shorty get dressed! "
Even them white girls tryna be my princess
But I only fuck with sisters like incest
I've been stressed, I'm so in-depth
I get this weight up off my chest like a bench-press
I sense death in the air, but it's nothing for me
Some niggas better be aware or meet the cousin of sleep, get it?
You slow niggas still ain't felt that shit
How she gonna upgrade me dog? I built that chick
Rapping's a cash cow, finna milk that bitch
You better hit up homicide, I just killed that shit, boy!
A dolla and a dream, thats all a nigga got
So if its about that cream, then I'm all up in the spot
I was raised in the F-A-Y (why), a nigga never gave me nothing?
Pops left me, I ain't never cry, baby, fuck him, that's life
And trust me I'm living, look what a nigga made out
The shit that I was given, look what a nigga came out
Momma sewing patches on my holes
Man, our hoes couldn't put this flame out
Straight up, I got my back against the brick wall
I'm from a world where niggas never pop no Cristal, it was pistols
You pass through, you better pray them bullets missed y'all
I thank the Lord, He let a nigga make it this far
A lot niggas don't, a lot of moms weep
I gotta carry on, all the weight is on me
You never know when a nigga might try to harm me
Rest In Peace that nigga John Lee, I pour liquor, homie
It's foul, but yo the world keeps spinning
Gotta keep winning, get up off this cheap linen
Nigga I'mma eat, even if it means sinning
Niggas want beef, I'mma sink my teeth in 'em
Pause, I go harder, I am all about a dollar
You niggas street smart? I'm a motherfucking scholar
So trust me, I ain't stopping 'til my money is long
So much dough, them hoes will think I'm rocking money cologne
Have a model at the crib waiting, "Honey, I'm home."
Cooking greens for a nigga, give 'em plenty, a dome
It's funny, we dream about money so much its like we almost got it
Until we reach up in our pockets, its time to face reality
The ville is a trap nigga now
And if you ain't focused you gonna be here for awhile, yeah
My nigga Mike rolling with me, riding shotgun
Type a nigga know about every car, but don't got one
That's hunger, no wonder niggas fucking with the evils
Posted on the corner, selling crack like its legal
But who am I to judge how a nigga get his paper?
This money coming soon, dog, I'm tryna get my cake up
I guess I gotta wake up these niggas myself
An E&J sipper, but my shit is top shelf
Young J, the rawest shit you niggas ever heard of
A journalist nigga, call me the Fayetteville Observer

You know the routine, man
Fayettnam
Real niggas can relate
And Ville niggas can relate, man
My niggas know about the struggle, man
What you know about your momma sewing patches on your holes, nigga?
I had the light blue jeans with the green patches, haha, oh shit
I was in like first grade man, I swear
It was like the Sixes came out, the Jordan Sixes
Them shit was so fly man, I wanted them so bad
Darryl what up man?
My nigga Darryl had them shits on in class yo
I wanted that shit so bad
I begged my mom for that shit, you know
But she couldn't afford it, yo, she gave me
Got me some Reeboks black tops, ahaha
But that was all good tho, cuz uh
The year after that I had, I had some, some no name shits
Some all black shits, haha
Them shits had metal, metal shoelace buckles and shit, you know?
But you know back then niggas didn't
Niggas ain't even know he was broke man, no worries and shit
But uh, times have changed man, I got bills
My mom is in debt, what you know about that?
College loans and shit, nigga
Gotta get this money, ma
We came a long way from stick and move
Niggas skipping school, just to scrap over bullshit
Nigga if you lose, it's a wrap, them hoes clowning
It goes down in the lunch room
I'm tryna spit this game nigga, fuck food
Bust moves to the hallway
My niggas posted on the wall, always
Ain't thinking about class, dog, my ass tryna parle
If we had this shit our way
We be standing here all day
But look the principal's coming, give pounds then we all escape
All late to class with fake passes
Living life in the fast lane, but ain't passing
They dreaming, tryna be the next Jay-Z and Dame Dashes
I ain't even open my book and it's time to change classes
Walk straight past my ex and don't speak
It's all good, I'll probably have a new ex by next week
I just think, the shit we did was silly, yo, I know that
But what I wouldn't give to go back
Yo, I walk another nigga girl to her class, with my hand on her ass
If he say 'what up' later, I just laugh
Real sneaky yo, gotta keep it low
Up in math, let my nigga read this real freaky note Kiki wrote, yea
Hooping up in P.E. you can't see me on this gym flo'
But damn Vanessa booty looking sick up in them gym shorts
Uh, we bag 'em up, ya'll niggas gonna have to wait
So they passing hate like, 'Damn I can't wait 'til they graduate.'
But some of my niggas will probably never make it
The S.A.T. shit man I doubt they ever take it, cause
Instead of tryna send a nigga to a tutor
Them guidance counselors tryna introduce us to recruiters, it's a set-up
Momma cut the light on, time to get up
Make sure the shirt matching the forces then I head out
At the time I thought this shit was so whack
But what I wouldn't give to go back
Yeah, hey
I'm a little grown, but still reminisce
Close your eyes nigga, you remember this?
Friday night football game, something I'll forever miss
After parties in the gym, grinding underneath the rim
You forgot your school I.D? Fuck, nigga, you ain't gettin' in
In the hallways acting like some hoodlums
See that scrap? Naw, damn I always miss the good ones
Them rumors spreading fast with that he say she say
Twenty people on the phone cause everybody did three-way
Man we played them girls for the fools, but
Wasn't no ladies like them ladies from other schools
Cause seeing them same old chicks got tired quick
She was just fucking my boy, now she all on my dick, gossip, damn
Another chick pregnant, another nigga gone
I reminisce on all the chicks a nigga never bone
Pardon me ya'll I'm just flipping through some Kodaks
Sitting, wishing I could go back
The heir to the throne
South nigga bred to the bone
But haters say he fled from his home (please)
Now picture that, I was 18 with million dollar dreams (yeah)
Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akeem
But ain’t looking for no queen, (nah)
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup)
City on my back, I just lift my wings, I’m fly
You niggas on my dick, why lie?
Thought them niggas from the south couldn’t spit, violá
I’m here. humble out of respect, not fear
So please be clear, nigga please beware
I’m a motherfucking monster, B.S. me? (naw)
No, my hand game like fucking PSP
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon
My dick do the damn thing, honey it’s cumming soon
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (yea)
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave
Rest In Peace, ya’ll boys living too fast
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash
Ville niggas don’t play
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won’t spray?
Mid-day when it’s sunny, they kill niggas broad day
On some old new jack shit
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run
Yea, uh
They say I act like I’m the man, 'cause motherfucker I am
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams
Damn boy I'm so flamboyant with the ensemble
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo
And I’m the man, now understand a nigga bossin’, (yea)
Scheming on that drop top CL but it’s costing (yea)
Long term plans for the fam, we’ll be golfing
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless i’m flossing (woo)
In the streets niggas peaceful until you force em'
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss ‘em
Goddamn you niggas got handled
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for ‘em
I know who did it, but you think I’m finna squeal on him?
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him
That’s word, nigga observe my genius
E&J sipping got a nigga straight leaning
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking, (haha)
I told y’all I’m the man, what the fuck ya’ll niggas thinking?
Straight out The Ville and I made it
Like a villain I'm hated
I see 'em grillin', I ate it though
Finna blow inflatable, that's undebatable, uh
I'm givin' niggas food for thought, the flow is catered, yo
I'm never faded though
Haters wanna see me broke, but me and the dough related, ho
It's like my only son, where I go, he come
Niggas dumb to be braggin' bout that stupid shit
Nah I don't stunt on niggas, I show'em how to do this shit
I'm somethin' like the light-skin version
Of the very same baby that The Virgin Mary raised
That's word to everything
Nigga life a scary game but I'm playin'
You sucka niggas lie in everything that ya sayin'
Shame on y;all, you tryna ball with the game on pause
A nigga pull the thing on y'all, y'all stain y'all draws
Fuck you niggas, but this ain't raw dog
I got protection, lethal weapons, and they aim on y'all
I'm like the man on mars; I'm high as hell
Watch me blow like I exhale, I excel in this rap shit
Cause y'all spittin' that wack shit
And every nigga suddenly be rappin' bout that trap shit
So while you niggas copy cat the cats that made classics
I just massacre the streets, I'm a master of the beats and the rhymes
I'm rappin' for the freaks and the dimes
And I shine like a mothafuckin' diamond
You shine like a mothafuckin' dime
That's word to my mom
I don't mind if you niggas hate
Just know you hatin' on that nigga, nigga get it straight
I'm spittin' hungry like ain't shit up on my dinner plate
The kind a flow that make a nigga hyper-ventilate (ugh)
See let me demonstrate
I grew up with nothin', it hurt me to see my mother poor
The only pops a nigga ever seen around was Huxtable
And so the muscle flow is something you can't get no muzzle for
Look how the buzz will grow
Ballin' 'til the buzzer blow
Man I'm hungry, does it show?
Ain't nothin' funny, fuck a joke
I'm gettin' money til my pockets need a tummy tuck
I hope you niggas woke now, impermanentely
Send you to hell, you meet the devil, sign a permanent lease
Word on the streets is I'm the prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the King, nigga: young simba
Word on the streets is I'm the Prince nigga, check the splendor
And I can't wait to be the king, nigga: young simba
These niggas is playing
Russian Roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless, no, we don't dance
All we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be LeBron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it
Yeah, I had this little bad thing, somethin' like them tens
She gave a nigga mad brain, somethin' like The Wiz
But, you see, the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains, dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her about the world
And about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like, "Baby, look at how we live broke on the boulevard"
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it, she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down fo'
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down fo'
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin'
You feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause, she be healin' that shit
And naw, that ain't your girl, dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the meantime it's lights, please
So now we in the hotel, mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's, I hear her and I'm willin'
But every time I smoke, well, a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke, well, I'm tryna put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they love to see us all go to prison or die
Like, "Baby, look at how they show us on the TV screen"
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it, she workin', jerkin' it nonstop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip, I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin', the more I grow
The more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules, but yet y'all tryna play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make?
Coward nigga, you a fake
How you gonna look in your son's face and turn your back
Then go start another family?
Dawg, what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay, rub my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper, like she was recordin' tracks
Said "I know you wanna change the world
But for the night, please
Just reach over and hit the lights please"
Lord, please forgive me for my sinning
I ain’t saying that I’m finished, but I’m praying in advance
Cause the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants
Yeah, ball game
I swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans when a nigga took the chance and came to the big city
My beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me
Like Bobby had Whitney, we was cooking up crack
But them fifteen credits had a nigga off track
Picture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes
The best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s
But mastered this rap shit
You hear the words coming from my lips bastards
I never crack, I got that Chapstick
I practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter
Now where’s the ladder?
Cause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter
Know you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though
‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral
We never tattle, let God handle that
Or let the mob handle that
No Soprano, half black, half white; I’m a piano
I’m an animal, my video on Discovery Channel
I’m a beast when my shit hits the streets, these niggas cease to exist
Like a beach in a tsunami, you'll find me in the ‘Ville
In the state of NC
Bitch, if I ain’t back home, I’m up in NYC
‘Bout that money prob-ly like a fucking robbery
But I ain’t jacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
I’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking
Hey, take a hard look at my drive nigga, no hacking on my shit
I’m straight smacking niggas, straight tagging niggas
Yo, I freestyle and fuck you niggas, ya’ll be wilding and I’m out
Now I was dreaming 'bout a deal at the age of thirteen
I was fiending for the mills, I ain't talking Burger King
Some of my niggas in the Ville, all they did was serve fiends
Fuck scales, I had skills, all day rehearsing
Them pretty boys had them gals, spent they time flirting
All they wanted was some waves like they fucking surfing
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, I ain't hating, do your thing
I was like a young Simba; couldn’t wait to be the king
Now a nigga is the prince
Hopped over the fence where the grass way greener
Look at shorty ass, way meaner
Something like Serena mixed with Trina, have you seen her?
She fine enough to be Ms. Howard, word to Adina
My money like a senior, watch it graduate
Now it's time to eat, I’m letting all my niggas grab a plate
Gravitate to real shit, stay away from phonies
These niggas heard about me, now they acting like they know me
Pardon the interruption, a proper introduction is necessary
When your shit is legendary, man
Greedy niggas wouldn’t let me in the cafeteria'n
'Cause they ain't believe, suddenly they Presbyterian
The hoes is librarians; they looking me up
She got to Jones like Marion, she licking me up
Then we cut, look how she say my name
I got her moaning "J. Cole", they used to say Jermaine
I never change, I'm like a corpse in a coffin; six feet, shit's deep
I was low, just a dollar and some hope fixed me
'Cause I was broke, plus the weed that I would smoke would make it worser
Lord, please let my problems disappear like Ron Mercer
I’m a star; Converses
Conversin' with them girls with them curves like cursive
They open like curtains
'Cause my shit is unheard of like curses on the radio
Same bitches used to play me though, now they yelling—
Yeah, I left the city for a minute, but it's still on my back
Told my niggas "Ay, I'm finna put the Ville on the map
I'll be back, and I'm coming with a deal and a plaque."
'Cause I'm ill, bitch, they couldn’t make a pill for the rap
Pouring liquor for my niggas that was killed, send 'em back
Came home, shit is real, niggas still in the trap
Hold up now, don’t get it twisted, if you slang, do your thing
Me, I'm like a young Simba; I can't wait to be the king
Witness the dream
Straight out that Carolina water, I was brought up
In the city where the skinny niggas tryna be the ballers
Ain't no fathers, but the skinny niggas tryna hit they daughters
Sneaking in her crib, but her momma never caught us
What they taught us?
Man, them bad bitches only want the ballers, the starters
We hooping, now the hoes wanna guard us
Uh, okay, so play D—know what I mean?
And I, I, I'll put you on the team
Man, this life is but a dream and I need a fast car
Bad broads, fast forward; passport
I'm a fucking rap star
Yeah
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing
Probably cause I never could
Said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first little taste of paper and I splurged
I guess it's just a nigga urge
This is The Boondocks
I swear, yo, I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be tryna save the world, and then on Friday, I hit the club
Hoping that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting, damn
Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live, my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't staying the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ay, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?
Yeah, I'm sipping liquor for the pain, pouring liquor for the slain
Nothing else can do the trick like hard liquor to the brain
Fall victim to the game, all this money we spent
In my mind, tryna figure where this 20 G's went
Maybe I should slow it down, maybe take the pace slow
Second thought, I think I need to speed it up and make mo'
Time to build, Lego, in the Ville, laid low
Counting days, still waiting on that shit I prayed for
Am I ungrateful? Want it all so quick
Feel a vibrate, hold up, I got a call, old bitch
How she get my new shit? Swear the city too small
Type of chick won't take her shirt off cause her titties too small
I could give a damn, girl, lift up that pretty blue bra
Now I'm in the deep, seeing just how pretty you are
And that kitty go hard
Lord, I'm up in that
Got the type of kitty cat that make a nigga double back
Type of shit that make a nigga wanna fall in love with that
At the door wit a towel on and nothin' under that
Saying welcome
Hey, yeah
Yeah, welcome
Yeah, yeah
I let these words flow out like water from a spout
Like rain from the clouds, rush the pain from the crowd
Cause these words go deep from my soul when I speak
Then the flows hit the souls of all those that I've reached
If I die 'fore I wake, hope my songs live on
Will they miss me when I'm gone and if so, for how long?
So much shit is on my brain, try hard to maintain
Sit and analyze my thoughts, at times I wonder if I'm sane
Man, it's hard to trust friends when the paranoia blends
With the marijuana, wonder will this high ever end?
Swear I'll never smoke again, y'all niggas blow the weed
Let me take another shot, man, this liquor's all I need
Just to put me in the zone, so far away from home
Nobody truly know me, got me feelin' so alone
They wonder what's on my mind, what's lingerin' in my dome
I tell 'em ain't nothin' wrong, I deal with it on my own
I deal with it on my own
Miss high profile caught you shopping on Canal
I guess it makes sense, it seems phony as your style
Your hair and your nails just as phony as your smile
Fake eyelashes, you drew your eyebrows
It make a brother ask, do you pride yourself?
Your make up like a mask, tryna hide yourself
It seems on the outside, you thinking you the shit
But there's a soul that's inside that you don't even knew exist
So you so out of touch that the world mistreat you
Rich niggas fuck you and broke niggas beat you
Hoping this will reach you when you understand
That your value ain't determined by another man
'Cause right now you let them brothers get the upper hand
And you just tell them "go deep" like Cunningham
And you just let them OD like Len Bias
And that pussy so good he let his friends try it
I look around at my city, this is SinVille
That boy eleven-years-old and can inhale
Sometimes I ride around wondering if we in hell
Or why do cops love to throw a nigga in jail
I'm bout to lose it, I just had another friend killed (damn)
Over some bullshit this cycle's like a windmill
I had a convo with my soul I asked it "When will, this shit change? "
It said boy "Just use them pen skills"
And so I write this for my niggas on the corner
Love you 'cause you my brother, so I feel I got to warn ya
This shit ain't set up for a young brother to advance
On that note, you niggas playing right into their hands
Damn, better get yourself some goals, you niggas better dream
I know the hood raised you but it's bigger better things
And for those that passed, I need a moment of silence
Sssssshhhhh
I got a thing for this little mama
She do it to me plus her brain is forreal, I'mma sucka for love I guess
Won't catch her up in the club cause she ain't into that
Kind of chick that rather rent a flick and get intimate
Say she never fuck with thug niggas only gentlemen
And yea that ass is fat but what's better is her intellect
Other men would sweat her when we walk past
Can't even blame em' did the same when I saw the ass
Match with the thin waist, brown with a slim face
Love the conversation and the kicks was like a sensei
Now she got me chillin' with her all around the clock
My homies beefin cause I never come around a lot
Keep on telling me I changed and things ain't the same
And ever since she came around I never want to hang
They tell me that it's foul how a chick can make me switch
But man I can't help it dawg, her mind got me whipped
Now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts."
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name."
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him."
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah
If my heart stop pumping tomorrow don’t feel no sorrow
'Cause life is hard mentally and everything is meant to be
Sometimes I ask myself If I was gone who will remember me?
It's hard to tell oh-well sit back and sip this Hennessy
Now lately it's been hard to tell my friends part from my enemies
Cuz plenty niggas show me love but in their hearts they envy me
Why? I'm just a nigga from around the way
Told my momma I'll make it happen and I found a way
Pour out some liquor for my niggas at the crossroads
And may the Lord give guidance to the lost souls
I know that deep inside these niggas know it's more to life
Then mackin' hoes and stacking dough
Man I'm sort of like a nigga who done seen greener grass
So when they think they ballin' like The Dream Team
My nigga I done seen meaner cash
And I'm tryna get it, follow me nigga I'm on a prowl
Headed to the top! You watching me nigga?
Then hold it down
You were my nigga from the younger days, we grew up
I went to school you went the other way
But still my brother man, I'm sitting, reminiscing on
All of them bitches we were tripping over, kissing on
Or at the skating rink we trying to bag some new hoes
And If I need gear, you let me hold ya new clothes and vice-a-versa man
But now that life is worser man a nigga slow caking
I'm broke tryna chase a dream, you just got probation and I'm stressed
Your little sister pregnant what’s next?
Oh shit my mama doing drugs, at times it's hard to feel blessed
In this madness I holla at my nigga in the sadness
Remember when ya mama tried to beat you with that bat shit?
Remember your chick Nina man that ass was the fattest
Remember my crush on Sabrina? yo, she still the baddest!
I'm just glad that I can holla at you, it's been a while
And til the next time I hear from you, ay, hold it down!
And these are tough times baby but we’ll make it through
You know I'm headed for the top I swear I'm taking you
Just hold a nigga down through this bad weather
The rain falling ain't balling but I have better
A women with an ass and a strong mind, it's been a long time
Sometimes you on your bullshit, sometimes I'm on mine
Will I have a hard time to stay committed?
Or do I only want your voice moaning when I hit it?
Man only God knows
I know deep in your heart you don’t want me to be no star though
'Cause groupies out there every show you scared I'm fucking every ho
And girl I ain't gon' lie and say I won't 'cause shit you never know
But may the Lord give me strength, I love you more than anything
The future mother of my kids, the love is real and if we ever part God forbid
I love you still so when I'm on the road don’t trip, you know im down for you
Keep it tight and don’t slip, and hold it down for me
Yea, keep following me, keep calling me
Yea, yea, yea

Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed
The beauty of life, the pain never last
The rain always past, the sun don’t always shine
When its gone I'm lonely, but when its there Im fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think Im a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
Its funny, 100 years ago I woulda called this nigga master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say Im easily distracted I think the problem is Im easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
Look niggas wanna know the formula for success
Sheeitt, but I studied for this test
Ay nigga I'm better than the rest you just rest boy please
Me I'm trynna stretch my treasurer chest, like some double D breast
So a nigga on a quest- no question
So I tell em birds no nesting
Laying in my bed hope to lay a niggas egg, No- you'll never hatch mines
Baby, you don't match mines
I'm trynna shine like the bat sign, when it's crime
And the gats flyin up in Gotham, watch em
Far from a thug but I'll drop one
Far from a scrub but I'll mop em
Watch 'em better leave 'em alone (Malone) like Stockton, when he retired
Shit your shit is fire boy stop
I don't buy it, boycott, stop lying
Ya shit is not hot man if niggas not buying
It's not rocket science
But the way I rock it help me build up my alliance
These niggas ain't playing in New York like the Giants-ha!
A little line to show love to the city that got no love
Don't want to see a nigga grow rather see a nigga hold-up
That's cold blooded, well never to fail
If you can make it here you can make if from heaven to hell
I'm just a little nigga strait out the Ville
Always been sick probably never get well
And no time soon, step to a nigga get 4 times 2
Bet the way I spit it leave your mind blew, with more rhymes due
Nigga you tryning who?
Sheeit, nigga you tryning me, bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Shit, nigga you trying me? Bitch I'm better than all them niggas you trynna be
Look, it's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch there's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
It's no time to chill I'm trynna get Mills
There's not time to chill I'm trynna build
Bitch it's no time to chill nigga! Yep
When she talk she so closed-minded
All she wanna do is shop, she so clothes minded
Wanna cop the latest 'fore them other hoes find it
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it
Probably 'cause she so fine it'll blow your mind
She black and Pocahontas, laid back and blow that chronic
Ass so fat, wanna tat my logo on it
So any other nigga that a tap will know it's mine
I put in work overtime
Let me cut, mow the lawn, guarantee I blow your mind
She tried to play me 'til she learned I wrote a rhyme
"That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, oh girl, that boy the bomb
No chain around his neck, but better watch out for the charm"
You're not my daughter, um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies
She said "I got a man", well, baby I don't give a fuck
See me I understand, and I ain't tryna split you up
Okay, give me your number and later I'ma hit you up
If you sleep I get you up, ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up, yeah, do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my t-shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on, come hop up on this ski jet
You scared of that water or you just scared to get your weave wet?
Barely got your feet wet, yes, I know where we headed
Tryna see you throw it back, let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for
You could be my cuddy buddy, baby, what are friends for?
I speed up the tempo, them other niggas lazy
Can't fuck with nuttin' younger than the eighties
I'm grown and I'm looking for some ladies, ladies, yeah
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!
Beautiful ladies, yeah
Now I ain't tricking, but I got a couple tricks under my sleeve
Ladies, yeah
Now clap your hands one time if you know you look good
All you ladies, yeah
Now if you from the suburbs or the hood (Yeah, ayy, look)
Beautiful ladies
Sometimes play the villain, sometimes play the hero
Sometimes I be Dilla, sometimes I be Preemo
Sometimes I be feeling, I got a big ego
Other times a nigga swim around like Nemo
Uh, small fish in a big ass pond
Pushed around like a mower on a big ass lawn
I get my weight up, inflate up
And make these old niggas open the gate up
At the mansions that they laid up in
Like, "Hello my name is Cole" - I'm walking right up in and well known
Don't give a fuck it you gon hate it man, hey fellow
Either you follow me or swallow me bitch
And I done hit to many hoes to ever pause that shit
Now since I just seen my face up in the XXL
A few chicks want to text "let's chill"-how obvious
Girls from all over the world is my hobby
And I got a chick who stay in DC like a lobbyist
My old chick from Raleigh that I still like to parley with
Just to hear that accent, now come and get that back bent
The moans turn to screams, I can feel her climaxing
Now if you faking that baby you need to try acting
Hollywood shit, had a nigga feeling like the milkman
Deliver that due to body good dick
Feeling like I got game that Karate couldn't kick
Therefore I'm bagging things that you probably wouldn't get, what up
I'm a talk until you tell me shut up
Uh, and we can walk the beach until the sun up
Huh, I ain't gon lie I'm trynna get some cut up
Ay, so what up
Hey, you heard that huh?
Oh you ain't heard of me well I prefer that
Uh, I text my number to you did you get that?
Huh, well when you lonely baby you can hit back
And I'll fix that
Tell me is you with that, hey
Ay tell me is you with that
Ay tell em is you with that
Yea, ay baby is you with that? Yea
I wake up, hop out the shower spray cologne on while im dressing
They hollering about recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, Im live and breathing so to me that there’s a blessing
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no “F” in
Stepping out today, I got leave the crib
Momma stressing , I pray
That ain't no body gon’ pull the weapon out and spray
Cuz I don’t got no strap
And ever since we hit the depression niggas don't know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya’ll feel the glare I got to go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her
I'm fronting “What's your name?”
She told me, “Boy, you know me, don’t play no games
Now, look, they say you blowing up, hey, is it true, fired up?”
I say, “Girl, they wasn’t kidding like they tubes tied up"
Okay so word is spreading
That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle cuz I know they used to say Jermaine
So who changed?
Whats in name though, when niggas can't hang on-your shoe strings
The flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me?- Im just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real
Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!
This is where they shooting sideways
Boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we high to get away
Now come here ladies see we trynna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon mix it with this Goose, don’t throw it up
Yeah, yeah
Slim nigga, lyrically on my limbs
Bigga then a nigga hittin' the gym
Regular benchpressin' the bar
Ten steps up from ya'll, you could follow my lead
If you shoot for the stars, I guess you aimin' at me
But please hold your applause
Ya'll holdin' up the wall goddammit I'm on the flo'
Good Lord, can't you see me gettin' down on a ho
And she drop it so low she sittin down on the flo'
I never pound with the flo, at times I wonder
Aye when they listen to my shit man can they hear my hunger?
Or will these hatin' ass rappers try to steal my thunder
Aye this is big shit poppin', you gon' need a plunger
To take me under, niggas in trouble
You lookin' at Lebron James of the game
I could do anything that you name
I could blaze any rapper in the game that you bring
Pour gasoline on the brain, got the flame for that
So you hatin' niggas refrain from that
A little bitter cause yo game is whack
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
I'll let Elite breathe, yeah
A dollar and a dream, that's all a nigga got
So, if it's 'bout that C.R.E.A.M, then I'm all up in the spot
I'm just warmin' up, I'm hot but nah, I ain't flashin'
I never gave a fuck about no high-end fashion
And maybe I was too broke, maybe I'm just too dope
To rap about that regular shit, or bag a regular bitch
These niggas talkin' like they on the next level and shit
But Cole's flow so cold, Bet the devil get sick
How do you want it? So sick I make you mentally vomit
These rappers askin' for beats and they ain't even fit to be on it
I see 'em writin' about rappers, I should be sick to my stomach
Because they talk 'bout the future but didn't mention me on it
So now I'm back in the kitchen, cookin' I'm meant to be one of the greatest
No niggas seein' me, this century us and you hate it
Look how I played it, other niggas was jaded
Under-appreciated, now Carolina is rated
I let Elite breathe, yeah
Hey, uh uh uh
I let Elite breathe, yeah
I bet they never seen him comin', like a blind bitch you fuckin' from behind
It's the motherfuckin' dime, bitch I'm fucking up rewind buttons
My shit is jumping like Lebron
Fayettenam on my back like some scratches from your lady
On your mattress where they gave me that
I bet niggas can't wait to pay me back
While they relax, I stay in tip-top shape
And I stay up on my toes like some gym socks
Flip flops
Tell them hater to rehab, kick rocks
Game tight like Ziploc
Half black, other half white like Kid Rock
Try to tell it to a Cizz-op
Thought it would work, it did not
He told me "Nigga stizz-op
You know you is not", wrote the ticket and rizz-ocked
Fuck, this is for hip-hop, gassed up like a quick stop
They light a fire under my ass nigga my shit hot
Even if you squatted over volcanoes, niggas your shit not
I'm raw, but I kid not
Your shit flop, I give props to the legend
Praise God but I give not to the reverends
Lookin' up to the heavens like
"Where did all my blessings go?" You chase a dream
But then you stop, guess you'll never know
I got a show for you to watch, here's an episode, professional
Set to blow any minute now, many women smile
Look the lights and the action, and the cameras be callin'
You niggas got to log in, bitch, you fantasy ballin'
I snuck up like I planned to be, this ain’t random, we called it
Like once they get a hit of this, they hooked like that Twitter shit
Thought I get a deal and head straight to the dealership
But looking at my deal I probably can't afford benefits
Medical, dental shit, left but I always came
Back like a rent-a-whip, dirty ass game
Dog, I could run a kennel with all these bitch niggas
Who don't lift a finger yet they wanna ride in the limo with
Me, I switch the tempo on them sort of like Timbo on em'
Start talking that "we" shit, I pause Nintendo on 'em (hahaha!)
Start talking that beef shit, I turn to kimbo on em'
I got no words for these niggas I'm instrumental on em'
Yeah! And I'll still keep goin', keep flowin'
Aye, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that, a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spitting
This that pulpit, I’m hitting niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of sifting through my mail I feel like Cartwright, bills
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talking man I know how niggas feel
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump
They shooting niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up!
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinking that I’m slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'mma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival
Check it
Ay Sallie, I know I ain't been answering your calls
But shit, let me explain- it's because times been hard
Been running around trying find a job
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore
I still got your letters laying in my dresser drawer
You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gonna pay you back”
I got a dollar and a dream
Okay, I roll up, hold up, look at how I showed up
I blowed up, had a hole up in my pocket, now it's sewed up
They feinin' for that crack, you know that rock, I got that product
You niggas tryna stop it, better load up, I hang my coat up
Aye, I'm gon' be here for a while so I smile, haters
I'm on that green like a flower, like an alligator
Now or later, I'm serving niggas; I'm a sound waiter
Just tell me what you want, I bring that back an hour later
Look how I cater, dog what you afraid of? Nothing
They talking gangsta without no data, they fronting
Jackie-Chan, Jean-Claude-Van-Dam, straight stunting
I wish a nigga would say something
I'm a Carolina nigga, boy I got it on my back
Piggy back style I ain't talking 'bout no tat
And I'mma rep the Ville in every city that I'm at
And I guarantee I'm bringing home plaques
Shoutout to my brother Zach, and my mother, I love ya
Yea look ain't that about a bitch? This nigga on his own dick
They say I'm like the human body, I produce my own shit
And I tote my horns. A star when I was born
My name ain't James, my word is bond
Yea shoutout to Canibus, had a similar line 98-99
Damn, that was the times never mind dwelling in the past
You're listening to the future
The flows gets tighter, them hoes get looser
Then they wanna seduce ya like Medusa, be cool
I said I got a girl, she told me, "Me too! "
So that must mean you want a nigga to eat that seafood
Baby don't be foolish but call her I'll watch her do it
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?
This is the girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help
Yeah, It's Cole, won't lie, won't stop 'til the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are
Usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina, where I made it from
Cole world, no blanket, son
Girls fast how Jamaicans run
Puffing on the city where the Lakers from: L-A, L-A, la la
So high, everything is a “ha ha” for me
Dreaming of the days of a drop 500
And a bad bitch that'll go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry
If you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mind wondering now, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not, hope not, hope not, hope not
A wise nigga told me don’t chase that cash
Follow your heart, you’ll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass
Or does she wish to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face, just gassed
Like “baby girl, why you take this path?”
Stack in his hand, trynna make that last
All she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub titties in his face and laugh
Gotta try not to look fake, in fact
A little more money, like a few more 20’s
When you let that nigga grab your naked ass
Okay, he’s gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear
“This ain't the life for you, baby, let me take you out of here cause..."
Yeah, my niggas sit back, blowing the L
Only getting high cause we closer to hell
Nigga trying to live like Hova, but well
We broke and that dough coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard in the snow, in the hail
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells
My mom broke, but she posted the bail
Someway, somehow
Nigga feeling like the sun down even when the sun up
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trying to raise her son up
'Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor couldn’t give one fuck
While she singing
I woke up early in the morning, hoes blowing up my phone
I ain't used to small talking when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em, I'll holla later, man, right now, my mind's elsewhere
My mom's healthcare, get her out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail, frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince, but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'm worry bout my welfares
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight, I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up, look out the window, hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out there locking up some older head
So Goddamn homie, hold your head, and hold your head
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change, still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle, ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics as I sip
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin', I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin this shit one step at a time, that real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'mma find a way, cause hey
Damn it, them jobs out there ain't tryna pay, I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up and show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though sometimes we had less
Compared to some of my niggas
Down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
'Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now?
Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it
Reflection bring regrets don't it
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good."
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it."
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
You wanna know just where I'm at, well let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map but let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back, ayy let me tell you 'bout it
Man fuck them niggas I come back, ayy let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like "Man that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, whoa
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait
The best kept secret
Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through (The break up)
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie it's just 1 thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singing
To the window, to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me
(The make up) This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home I'm the best in the South
When I'm in LA I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Oooh I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (Maybe I'll stay)
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go
Ay from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie"
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Ay from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie"
If we at war, then this is a war that I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
I grew up, a fucking screw up
Tie my shoe up, wish they was newer
Damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm trying to stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I?
Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga Squirrel slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller
With more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch
And he gon' get it right back
I peep game
Got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn’t my mans
I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me
And show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, "Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick!"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, "I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God (Cole the God, Cole the God)
January 28th
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna be, happy
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, "Fuck the law," my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of 13
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
"What the fuck we naming this girl?"
I told her "Nina," the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
"Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects"
I had to interject like:
"Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"
He said, "Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready"
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy 12 years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, "Fuck the law"
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you
For your eyes only
I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, huh
Lord, huh
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord
Lord
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen.
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you
Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
("You soft!")
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
"Damn, what's gotten into you?"
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...
Ib gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit, hey mama look what God made
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes
There is a God, it is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time
