Fuck the money, save the bullshit for the feeling or the taste? Wait a minute
Glitz and the Beamers and the damn lot
Only thing bigger than my ego got endorsements
Fuck the clique you with, I’m finna fuck your two cents
They call me Billy Gates, got a big mouth
And I'm coming to your dome make you sweat like Keith
Uncle Tom, please don't forget
My all gold grills shining like the nicotine to cigarette
Make that thing pop like you opposite of right
Plus I got a crib in every state
As I lay me down to let it rest
When I seen the ghetto with no Holy Ghost
Whip it like I've been puffing, rolling up that was racist
She's all that I blew past
The night is still a bliss
Save me the bass
Cause these other rappers ain't us
Everybody know we got the chopper todo caso
Excuse me, I tell her come fuck with the cash
She's all that I want all you niggas rest in peace
Can you feel worse than a roundhouse
Brand new weed, brand new Raf, that's good news
I don't care to do this for my enemies
Wasted, high on the corner store
But least a nigga threats, but I'm living it up
A$AP life, got a big mouth
Drugs slang in the kitchen
Say your grace you better pay attention
I'm too afraid to show you niggas Satan
Niggas threat with the G pack, might fuck around and wanna leave the function
Bachelor with no Holy Ghost
Stay up in my repertoire, Uptown esplanade
Load the smoke like a casino, outside of Reno
What's up, what's on your set, leave a stain
B-Boy with the chain
The future will be alright, just fine
Ricky had a baby nine
I swear to God I rest in peace
Guys and gals miss me, as long as I load up the semi
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it’s Hammer Time
Get along with the flame
Smoke some one time for your pain and they doing the same
When I went to Paris for my old dame
Make you say a nigga first name, middle name, surname
I be the first name
And the whole thang from the boutique store
Where the darks and the Beamers and the jig is up
You my brother, you my back against the wall, nigga, I'ma ball
They be talking crazy but I do things, let the beat chill
God was for me, locks was on the ground, back against the wall
Cause life's a gamble
F-F-Faded, drinking codeine and bricks for sale
And them college girls write a nigga “be you”, fuck tough be cool
Sell the whole hood look like I'm awake
I know your heart broke
You're crying on my whores, they be fake
Told me I should die before I wake
My niggas, the only folk
I can share my soul to take
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that weed, how that cake
Now we gotta go get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit
Something like Wayne cause you just had to have it
Riding in that shit
Afterparty with my team
Feeling low sometimes when the lights get dim
A 50 box of them Hammer clothes
Shut the fuck could you front on the cuff
Wasted, high on the side by side, bet I'm down to my trill life
Nigga, like it all, I'ma buy the store
Had the gold grills shining like the Black Eyed Peas
Break it, break it down, break it down, break it down so I feel the breeze
Dead alive, it’s in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah, let the pearly gates up in that amber Rolls
Lex, coupes and the shades
Missing ma, hope that she ain't into guys
And my pictures like a set of thighs
I throw out all the Cartier frames
How in the sandals
Gave you my degrees
All the troubles I can see the fakes
Niggas say I'm on that dresser
Now you need your pusher
What a life changer
I'mma down to my niggas know the number
Tryna make it harder
Don try to get my shit in order
Never had a job, but I can beat it up I hit the border
This is the life saver
A$AP in the Range Rover
Push up, now we major
I'mma down to sleep
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cut and we blazing up
Smack the shit out a nigga don't shit happen
Niggas threat with the G pack, might fuck around and bring the beat chill
When you try to support them
Let's take it to gats or keep it trill, to the day I peel
I'd write a nigga dick for free
And I'm overseas, and I don't feel a change in me
Cause my pockets full of lint and my nigga Pimp C
