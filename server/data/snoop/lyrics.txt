Tonight there's gonna be a whole lotta smoke in the air
Blow it hard for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we putting one six feet underground
So blessed
What goes up must come down

Tomorrow when you wake up and realize life ain't fair
Throw it back and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had, 'til it's gone
When it's right, something always will go wrong

Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me? Yeah
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone, but you're never missed
Ashtrays and heartbreaks

So raise a glass to the memories
Set em' free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays

Now my buzz is gone, and I need to re-up on reality

On the Chucks, French braids, and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with the fog on the window
Spell ya name in it, put ya face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gang bang spinach

My money is green, and my Porsche is turbo
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Baby's a lawyer, her body's the truth (Cute)

Got a model on my lap, baby show me what you got
With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy
Girls who like girls, wanna do it to daddy

Smoke good with T-Pain, and Snoop the weed doctor
Big 808, now feel the base in your chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta'
Coke bottle shape, light green eyes
Drunk off of love like a Colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs, I'mma smoke 'til I die
Just bust a bad one, for my homie D. Dimes
They do it for fortune, some for fame
I got five different strains, you ever taste Purple Rain?
Turn up the volume, adjust the game
Ain't a damn thing change, still a G-thang
Lil' mama whip your hair, exhale the chronic
As the smoke disappears, I'm ready to ball

And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg

Boom!
Say what? Say what?
Boom!
I don't think they heard you
Boom
Talk to 'em T-Pain
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish
And it's comin from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Timbs and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla
If she a baller, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin out the Doggfather
'less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor
Say when I pass you that weed and I ask you can you roll?
You say roll, don't you know that I'm from round here?
Well girl I like the way you roll

Beast up, suck up to none, don't be no sucker
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucka

Real mash with my Spanish

Don't get put up in your place

Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin' it

Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So go on and get yourself a bar of this
No change, man, gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell, they call it 'Deez Nutz'

I'm almond with the caramel insides
You appear frontin' with the French fries
How it feel, man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin' on some Bud Light

Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one, candy

I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin' to chunk, make the *** all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady

Yeah, she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I feel good about candy
My gangstas understand me

Shake it, baby, don't break it baby
Now can you make it clap?
Tryna fit this work in your gap
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you, then I step on it to bubble on

It's gettin' sweeter than a sugar cane
Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin' on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin', boy
'Cause I can't leave this filthy game without my Almond Joy

It's like candy, candy

Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
While I tadaa check out this bizarre
The D A T, the N I double G, the D A Z

Again, it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for s***
Goddamn, you already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?

Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip
Yeah, *** shot caller
It's America's number one baller

Man, I don't give a *** like, "*** it"
High riders, slide in the bucket
Little momma all up on a *** like a coat
I got the perfect thang that'll coat her throat
I put down more hits than mafioso made
And Lucky Luciano 'bout to sing soprano
And I know, I know the way you feel
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real
Just to get you caught up in amazement
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes
Man, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga
I'm Tha DoggFather

Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)
We got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)
I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on
Let me flow on
You can rock to tha rythme you see
Or you can rock to tha rythme of me
Just remember when you do your thang
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh
(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather

Now, do anybody in tha house remember
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
There wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women
That's the truth from the begining
In and out of the flyest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's formost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'mma git back to tha grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather
Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack

So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y

Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that something?
Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, It's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'

She used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)

Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I’m head huntin'
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you, you fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog
It's somethin about the West Coast, that makes me thank the East
Eastside! Eastside!
And somethin about the West Coast, that makes me bang the beat
HELP ME SING IT!

Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you

Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue

Bam! Boom! Whatchu gon' do cuz?

It's the S-N-double-O-P'n
Biggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n
And since I got time to drop it for you I guess I must
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are "Contagious", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home
Snoop to the D-O-Double G (uh-huh)
Get in where you fit in, follow me (ooh!)

I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we ain't fuck with thousands
We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg palace
With a car fulla bitches cookin grits like Alice (ooh!)

Take two and pass it, it will not burn you
From the Long Beach Chronicles to the Wall Street Journal
They all know the G with the Cutlass Coupe
Ask Bill Gates, "Yeah I know the homie Snoop"
Yeah, I'm straight loc'n, hangin wit my folk and
Follow Rakim cause "I Ain't No Joke" and
Cuz, I done seen so much (like what?)
Enough to have your feelings touched
When the gunshots ratta, all your boys scatter
Check up on your homies but they gave ya bad data
Make a nigga stop BREATHIN, have his soul relievin'
And now you niggas believe in
What I say cause what I say is so real
Homie you don't wanna see the steel!
You dont wanna catch a body, you came here to party
Now that's what you should do, now where's my baby boo? (ooh!)

Blowin trees, summer breeze, sippin Coronas
Boss Dogg, I give it to her right, and she like it
She on the hip like a Sidekick
Is he, one of the coolest of fool on the flo'?
I whispered in her ear, "C'mere, you're ready to go?"
I rolled up a winna and put it up in the air
Got that lil' dress on, you comin up outta there, yeah!

You say you bite, well I bite back

Kissin on ya chest and I'm diggin out your stress

But you ain't felt love 'til a gangsta get up in it

Cause I'm a Dogg, I'mma give her what she like
She say my name loud, I say her name low
That's what I aim fo', that's how the game go
Baby like the way I wake her up (why?)
Cause I'm a gangsta, I grab her by the butt (oh)
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep
Woke that ass up, just to put her to sleep
Everyday, it's the same thang, I creep in
It's like "True Blood", I sink my teeth in
I gotta have it, the L.B. raised me
We was taught to dick 'em down crazy
Lights out, I'm so lit
Mommy so gone, daddy won't quit
I won't stop 'til you're finished
You ain't felt love 'til a gangsta get up in it
...Dream

Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin Vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka cuz
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cutthroat on the down-low
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...
Ladies and gents, playas and pimps listen
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the mic, pay attention
One, two, oh what shall I do?
I'm slipping on my khaki suit (Which one?)
The blue one, gun by my side as I mob to the beach
On a mission and I'm fishing for my DJ Warren G
Now I look for the bud sack
And see where my loves at on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Sagging like a mothafucka, khakis to they knees
Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg, not your average motherfucka, see

Some of you don't know about the G thang, baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be driving ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the beat and ya move to the sound
I'mma hit ya up with the Pound, G's up, hoes down
(Well, all the real G's, please stand up and let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch, then you're rolling with the Row)

I don't fuck with the pocus, everbody knows this
Fucking with the Chronic, cause the Chronic gives me dopeness
Now focus your eyes on these, follow me
As I take ya rolling with the real OG's
East Side is the motherfuckin' place, known as home
Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, twenty grand and
Aww naw (who is it?)
It's motherfuckin' Snoop Dogg
I live the fast life, WHILE ya keep ya cash tight
In broad daylight, walkin' wit ya flashlight
Addin' up what ya brought in from last night
She mad tight with mad bite (is that right?)
Bad lil bitches on my tizeam (tizeam)
Nigga, that's the American drizeam (wha-wha-wha-what)
Pussy broke the President (yeah it did)
And pussy made a pimp rich (yeah it did)
I live like I'm both as I smoke on my dope
On my boat...thumbin' through c-notes

Now here's a toast to the coast
Cuz we doin' it the most (we doin' it the most)
Playa playa high costs
Uno, dos, I'm bout to get ghost
Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G

You niggas sippin on that jealousy (jealousy)
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (want some?)
Do you wanna have a sip with me?
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (trip with me?)
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time
Me and my niggas in the sunshine (sunshine)
On 3 wheels with one 9 (ya know)
It's time to shine, the world is mine (the world is mine)

I never ever dropped a dime (shiiit)
Nigga might cop a dime
Never hesitate to pop a 9 (bah!)
And always come up with the proper line
Stick to the script bitch I'm hurtin shit (hurtin shit)
Let me show you motherfuckers what I'm workin with
(what you workin with?)
Don't need no water to go with your order
And you ain't got to smuggle the shit up over the border
Affordable, sportable, unbelievable, feasible, and reasonable
We leavin' 'em low
Cuz me and my loc, keep big leaves of smoke
Gallons of Hennesey and 16 liters of coke
He done drank and she done smoked
The meters are broke, we put the V to the note
I brought the weed to smoke
And Dr. Dre, he hooked the beat up, indeed it was dope

Stackin what ya mackin D-O-double G
The shit ya doin' is so lovely
The haters hate cuz they can never be
There ain't no limit to this melody (melody)
You niggas sippin on that jealousy (jealousy)
I pour a tall glass of Hennesey (Hennesey)
Do you wanna have a sip with me? (sip with me?)
Or would you rather try and trip with me? (trip with me?)
Put ya cups on the table and your hands in the air
And touch your brim to the side, that's only if you a player
And all the ladies in this motherfucker acting up
Don't hurt nobody when you back it up
Cuz we came here to have a good time

G Mix!!!! I was a fiend, before I became a teen
I melted cabbage sacks instead of cones of ice cream
Crime orientated that's how the west was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzle, complicated
I dropped the sack and tried to rap hits y'all
They tried to bang on me, and say that I'm too small
Cool!!! Cause I don't get upset
I call the king of the east catch a flight then I jet
Right back to the west, where my niggas is at
Scoop the gilly put it back on the map

And slam em on they back and tell em "vamanos"
Tae Bo, five, four, three, two, one
Working out, chiefing up, creeping up, keeping up
With the Joneses, smoke a zone with my pen pals
In my neighborhood, flavor's good, roll up, put some papers to it
Straight into it, gon' make him do it, that thing can do it fo sho
Get my lift on, while get my spliff on, fo sho
Break bad, stay cool, way cool, roll a doob
Old school, paid my dues, spray these fools, ladies drool
Cause they know what I got
I got a bag of the Saturday pot
And it'll keep you up from Thursday to Saturday night
What do you like?
When you smoke with the Dogg, you had the time of your life
Now light... the fatty, jump in my Cadi
Pull your seat back, yup, I know you need that
Let it flow, set it go, incredible
That ain't gold, laying low like 10 to 4, on the floor

Don't even trip
Ain't really gotta use a scale, I could eyeball a zip
So much weight you thinkin', “Why this ain't for sale?”
Weed in my lungs, weed in my nails
She coning joints, I'm rolling weed up myself
Don't ever get my weed from off the shelf or my clothes
I heard Polillo 'bout to drop some shit, order those
Pounds, I got more of those, why my eyes sorta low
Not too many when I roll, more arms than [Goro] though
Boys hating, I'm just counting up the money I just made
And what I'm making make a nigga make a million dollars later
Smoking getting high pays
I like my eyes glazed
Ain't empty out my ashtray in days
At my house playing pool in some HUF socks and Joyrich sweats
I roll a joint, you roll another one next
Can't even name a nigga colder than
Ain't pay for game that mean you stole it then
Know it's the bomb when you hold it in
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A
I'm just looking, mm-mm-mm
Looking at the ladies

We could do what you want to
You say you drink Alize, or was is Malibu?
It don't really matter though
You remind me of the time when I had a ho
She kept telling me, "Doggy Dogg, I gotta go"
So I let her get in the wind and co-macked her friend
Two plus two, it equals four
This is some shit that could last forever more

And don't ask where we going, pimping and hoeing
Drink pouring and weed blowing, you know it, come on!

Party all night 'long
1992, "Deep Cover" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop
"Doggystyle" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb
One of the greatest hip-hop records of all time
I was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free
Got on and I brought the whole Pound with me
Didn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G
Niggas knew it was Eastside L.B.C
Gangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get
The one up above didn't like my pace
I was movin' too fast and I caught that case
I fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case
I slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned

I'm finally out
And the critics hated on me cause I went to the South
Said I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead
Switched sides, now my old boss want me dead
Dropped the first of the three and you said it was weak
"No Limit Top Dogg", the return of the beast
So from that point on I know what to do
Don't worry 'bout them just do what you do
"Last Meal" was the one that took me off the leash
That's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me
Stack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold
I'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga

Bo$$ of the City, Boss of the Coast
Some other niggas tried but none of 'em come close
They stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc
The Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke
(Wow!) That's what it's about
They tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth
Motherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man
Freedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban
So they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk
To some women as hoes, like it's my fault
Damn they lost, man they just don't know
That a bitch is a bitch, and a ho is a ho
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss
Let them heaters cock and let them leaders talk
I'mma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga
Money makes a man and that's a crime
If we all were rich, we'd spend more time
With our daughters and sons, they're losing their minds
We all feel hurt, here's mine, hear me now

Let the music play, me don't want no more gunplay
When the bodies hit the ground, there's nothing left to say, ay, ay
Me don't want to see no more innocent blood shed
Me don't want to see no more youth dead
Come hear me now

Yeah, yeah, yeah, news from back home
This when it hurts to be gone
Two more young names to be carved out of stone
One summer day that went horribly wrong
Got my dawg on the phone
Cryin' and sayin' to leave him alone, but I'm not leavin' his side
I know that somebody died, somebody's child
Some people ducked down and some people hide
Some people just cannot react in time
Bullets do not choose a victim
It is the shooter that picks 'em
They just can't wait to get you in the system
The district attorney could use a conviction
Told you no guns and then you didn't listen
Life is so heavy with that on your soul
Dedicate this to Shyanne and Josh
And pour sumthin' out for the lives that they stole
416
She too fly for words
And where I'm at now I'm too high for birds
Shorty, what you think about my return
Cuz what he think about it ain't my concern
I ain't come for you, I came for your Missus
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players
Well okay, I do it for the riches
But in the meantime and in-between time
Shorty right there gon' get it if she with it
If she ain't, then I know her partner down
Cuz her partner throwing shots every time I turn around
And her partner bringing partners every time I come to town
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right there
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs
And when I come down he can bring it back, word

I came to cut right now
Bigg Snoop Dogg and I came to get down
Yes, I'm internationally known
Libra lovin' make you moan and groan
Burn my gas like race cars
Two bad broads with the bass on
I never met a girl that I'd wait for
I seal my deal like Jay does
All that and then some
Pimp real for real when I win some
I remember what you're thinking
Black shades on, drinking while you're blinking
Something fly, white limousine
Make a clean getaway
I loved your clothes, what you about
The way you let it out

She 'bout to go in
She likes that low end
Damn her ass is so big
Just keep it bumpin'
Peaches N Cream
Uh oh there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancing like she knows
She's the baddest in the place (Hey, hey)
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her Freak-Um dress on
Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's Paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this

Nigga had to walk 'bout four days
These niggas actin' like hoes nowadays
When I was young I used to hustle for my own shit
A 20 nigga slanging with them insane crips
I made my way out they call me Snoop Eastwood
Didn't forget where I came from, went back to the hood
Signed niggas, gave jobs and I made bail
And kept a lot of motherfuckers from goin' back to jail
Retail, hoe sale, OG's won't tell
Oh yeah they will, oh yeah they will
But I paid no mind I get back on my grind
I had a football dream to have a football league and I did that

Niggas said somethiing outta place, dawg
I'ma let it go, I can't catch a case dawg
These motherfuckers prayin' on my downfall
I run the paint when it comes to this roundball
See I'm a legendary nigga doin' legendary shit
Smoking on the blunt with your temporary bitch
One thing's for certain, two thangs for sho
I'm a Long Beach nigga everywhere that I go
If I do, if I don't, if I will, if I won't
See time is money and it's the first of the month
Quit actin' funny my nigga
And go get your money my nigga

Get it in, get it out, turn it up, turn it down
Big Snoop Dogg and Soulja Boy, told ya boy in your mouth
Make it bang, make it bounce, break it up, take it out
Nigga what you talking about? Snoop Dogg walk it out

Ya, you can set it up cuz we will neva let it up
And I’ll do it till you get enough, and I beat you dead and red and stuff
What it do, what it is, I see you haven’t read enough
This is the life I chose for me and this is the way I chose to be
A lot of fools is hating me but that’s just the way it’s supposed to be
Never went, against the grain, always banging 20 gang
Stand for something dawg or you gonna fall for anything but later for that
Yeah, I got my swag back, I’m with the Soulja Boy, now nigga bag, back
For them GCs and TCs we in the VIP, blowin on some Laker purple trees
Jerkin knees, workin these cute bad bitches

Break it down, spread it round, fire a pound
Put it in the air, right now like pronto
I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke

She might be with him but she's thinking 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the mall, we don't go out to eat, eat, eat

I was all in da club, havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all in the bar, wind drift up, Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now
With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say sh[it]"
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption
It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in - tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping, VIP they can't get in
If something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping

Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncing cars

Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instan

Bumpin' heads with niggas

Tellin' me about the money Suge Knight stole
But don't let that shit leak, 'cause nigga I get swole
Niggas tryin' to get in to get at me
Put me up on game, tellin' me who gon' jack me
But ever since I was a puppy 'til I was full grown

Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex

Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot

Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known

Hey... yeah that's life

I hit the studio, then back to the stage
The lights come on and the people start to wave
Then I seen this girl, she looked me right in the face
Like "I know you remember me and my homegirl Tanay"
We stay downtown in a loft on Santa Fe
And we your number one biggest fans to this day
Wait... baby girl I'm the great

Fuck them other dudes, I'm the man to be with
Fifty million sold, who's bigger than me bitch?

Every dog has it's day
Another dirty 9 inch dick classic, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
Girrrrl... As I sit here sit here thinkin' to myself
There is no one for you but me and I mean that
And I've think about all the things we been through
Like all gettin' fightin' for example
You know the love we have for each other
It tends to out weight what we would do to one another
You know my grand daddy used to always say
You know he used to say it like this..

What up motherfuckers, this is Snoop Dogg
I'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'mma do y'all
Hangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball
Givin' me the words on the street heres to scoop y'all
The niggas from the East Sidaz are split up (split up)
And one of 'em try to fuck your shit up (what?)
Nah cuz, don't believe that - that's my nigga for life
I'm out with the bullshit, I mean with the real shit
I'm at the church doing work, spittin' game for the pulpit
And that's the bidness and God is my witness
LBC, 213, hell yeah we in this - It's so relentless
And all my dogs up against the life sentence
I love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit
On some Crip shit - homie dig this

I used to have a lot broads that I don't fool with
I used to have a lot homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But would none of them believe it though (What?)
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
Cause we all gonna get that day (For what?)
To see if our lives was straight
And see if we would be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)
To see the man upstairs on some real talk homie
I'm tired of bein' stuck here
If I could I would fly to moon (zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms
I know
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish ?rope? with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these

I got a little cousin that's kinda plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle

I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors
Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to see Daz back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed
Uh-huh, hmm... I was chillin, right around my way (way!)
21st eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin shit with his homies like he was a straight.. G
Askin where I'm from while he runnin up
Gangbang, my set on e'ry one of 'em (true)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin but the gangbang (bang!)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep, on the East with it
Talkin 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (nmm hmm!)
But they don't know once they get close
It's Tic-Tac Toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out!)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three motherfuckers dead now I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case really you could see
I crack the Mac back and pop off rollin
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow? On my door? What the fuck yo!
See these niggas proceed to speed
So fulfill the need to leave or you'll hear my enemies goin...

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth God... damn!
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat
You never seen a thug like dis
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact I could be "Beast of the East" motherfucker!
I never hesitate to blaze (blaze!)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, cause my peoples
Is screaming that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Put the bang on the song, make it feel like a drive-by (drive-by!)
It's a shame but somebody's gotta die (die!)
They see it happens state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin L.A., all I hear the ese's say - they go...
I'm so smooth about my paper check it just how it's done
I'm servin any on a platter snoop dogg corleone
Corleone, now do you know what that mean?
A teflon don to this hip-hop game, super supreme
It's like what happen can happen but will it stop
That won't happen I'm feelin good about the mission for jackin

Ain't nuttin changed too down to hang I slang a bang with a rhyme
Me and the homey pac trippin death row on knobs
Gon survive by eastside of dpg'z
Still creepin bump through the hood, always involved in the streets

The big homey to you, there it is and there it was...
Now take a look through the eyes of g
And just ride to the rhythm of a gangsta beat

Come with me take a trip down south

What you wanna do tonight
It's still early
Wanna get spewed tonight
She's all sturdy
I'm in between your lips
Like a cigarette
She wanna quit
But she wanna make it, make it, make it wet

Can you, can you get me up?

So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper babe
But fuck them dollar bills
Girl make it rain
Holiday Inn, come
Meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
And I, apologize
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n slide
It's a flood in your heart love
Girl let me pop up in your hot tub
Every night every day
Sippin' on a different drink
Different chicks different days
I do it different ways
Where you going
What'd you say
I want her river flowing to another lake
Another ocean another ocean
On the beach on the beach
I'm bout to take a swim
Let let me dip my feet and get wet

From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I serve my 'caine
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit
So I ain't holdin nuttin' back
And motherfucker, I got five on that twenty sack
It's like that and as a matter of fact (rat-tat-tat-tat)
'Cause I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Yeah, so peep out the manuscript
You see that it's a must we drop gangsta shit
What's my motherfuckin name?

It's the bow to the wow, creepin and crawlin
Yiggy yes y'allin, Snoop Doggy Dogg in
The motherfuckin house like everyday
Droppin shit with my nigga Mr Dr. Dre
Like I said, niggas can't FUCK with this
And niggas can't FUCK with that
Shit that I drop 'cause ya know it don't stop
Mr. One Eight Seven on a motherfuckin cop
Tic toc never the Glock just some nuts and a cock
Robbin motherfuckers then I kill dem bloodclots
Then I step through the fog and I creep through the smog
'Cause I'm Snoop Doggy (who?) Doggy (what?) Doggy [Dogg]

Now just throw your hands in the motherfuckin air
And wave the motherfuckers like ya just don't care
Yeah roll up the dank, and pour the drank
And watch your step (why?) 'cause Doggy's on the gank
My bank roll's on swoll
My shit's on hit, legit, now I'm on parole, stroll
With the Dogg Pound right behind me
And up in yo bitch, is where ya might find me
Layin that, playin that G Thang
She want the nigga with the biggest nuts, and guess what?
He is I, and I am him, slim with the tilted brim
What's my motherfuckin name?

Me and my partner, in my Impala
Poppin our collars, tossin up dollars
A truck on the side of with hoes that wanna follow
Bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna swallow
Doggy Doggfather
I do it to you real hard then it gets harder
It's nada - thang on mine, I bang on mine
I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin bimbo
So quit knockin at my window, you nympho-maniac
Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it
It really don't matter what you spent on it
As long as you're gettin what you paid for
That's what it made for, ain't that what you stayed for?

You play me and I'll play you
You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't yo' thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valeted my keys and park my car
No snap shots cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin 'em props (whattup, whattup)
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gi-din, get my pid-in
Put my bid in, no bullshittin (no bullshittin)
We be sittin, in the corner
With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin in the sauna
Burnin up the charts (burnin up the charts)
Break a bitch heart, lil' mama don't you start

Tick tock, the ice on my watch
Slap me 'cross the face around two o'clock
But the party don't stop till we blow up (ka-boom!)
Now every lil' bitch wanna show up
Manuev'in to this, groovin to this
Dippin to this, flippin to this, trippin to this
Ain't no skippin to this, trust this
Bust this, it's too hot to touch this (ahh!)
He say, she say, I say no way
Don't need foreplay, okay, obey
Everything that I say..
And every day'll be like a holiday
I put you in the front seat of my car
And roll you 'round town like a superstar
Recline your seat and turn up the beat
Number one with a bullet, rollin down the motherfuckin backstreets

You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life
